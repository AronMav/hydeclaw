## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [v0.11.2]: Virtual Merging, IncrementalParser, Robust Thinking Indicator added but introduced regressions
- [Bug]: ThinkingMessage appears on new empty session (sessionStorage persistence never clears)
- [Bug]: ThinkingMessage stays after stream completion (no cleanup path)
- [Bug]: After F5 history doesn't restore, only thinking avatar shows
- [Architecture]: No XState — custom `chatStateMachine` pure function inside Zustand (zero deps, ~80 lines)
- [Architecture]: Keep `fetch` + `ReadableStream`, add exponential-backoff reconnect inline (no @microsoft/fetch-event-source)
- [Architecture]: React 19 `useOptimistic` for user message bubble; Zustand+Immer stays for live stream mutations
- [Architecture]: Keep `react-virtuoso` free `Virtuoso` — no upgrade to paid `VirtuosoMessageList`
- [Architecture]: `SseConnection` class (not hook/inline) — survives React re-renders, independently testable
- [Architecture]: `MessageSource` discriminated union replaces `viewMode + liveMessages` duality
- [Architecture]: `streamGeneration` must become per-agent — module-scope counter silently kills concurrent streams
- [Phase 40-sseconnection-extraction]: SseConnection.onDone called only on natural completion; finalizeStream is always natural-end path
- [Phase 40-sseconnection-extraction]: streamGeneration kept as module-global (per-agent is Phase 45 CLN-02 scope)
- [Phase 41]: ConnectionPhase runs in parallel with StreamStatus (Phase 45 CLN-01 removes it)
- [Phase 41]: IncrementalParser.reset() called on finish events to prevent reasoning state leaking between agent turns
- [Phase 41]: sessionStorage streaming flag cleared atomically in finish handler (not just sync)
- [Phase 41]: showThinking = connectionPhase === submitted || engineRunning (removed 4-signal expression and sessionStorage fallback)
- [Phase 42]: MessageSource discriminated union (new-chat|live|history) replaces viewMode+liveMessages dual-semantics in AgentState
- [Phase 42]: Per-agent streamGenerations[agent] Record — module-scope counter replacement prevents concurrent stream killing when switching agents
- [Phase 43]: onPhaseChange added as SseConnectionCallbacksWithPhase (extends base callbacks) — backward-compat, callers without phase tracking unaffected
- [Phase 43]: receivedFinishEvent flag distinguishes natural stream end from connection drop in processSSEStream
- [Phase 43]: reconnectTimers cleared in both abortActiveStream() and stopStream() — user abort must not trigger reconnect
- [Phase 44-ux-polish]: saveDraft(agent, '') removes the key — no stale localStorage entries
- [Phase 44-ux-polish]: totalPartsCount Stage 3 Fix useEffect removed — followOutput callback is single scroll authority
- [Phase 45-cleanup]: CLN-01: StreamStatus/isActiveStream removed — ConnectionPhase/isActivePhase are sole stream-state authorities
- [Phase 45-cleanup]: CLN-02: AbortController/timers in private Maps not Immer state; streamGeneration moved to AgentState as plain number
- [Phase 48-02]: OPTI-03: contentHash djb2 fingerprint + reconcileLiveWithHistory for flicker-free live-to-history transition
- [Phase 48-02]: OPTI-04: User message UUID-to-DB-ID swap is clean DOM swap (identical content); assistant IDs from SSE start event already match DB

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- No backend changes required for this milestone — all changes are frontend only
- `sync` event reconciliation during reconnect: verify `assistantId` reset behavior (open question from ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Optimistic user message UUID reconciliation strategy must be decided during Phase 43 planning
